## What can you do?
It's pretty simple. You can play Rock Paper Scissors. The fun beginns when you start picking some harder oponents. On the left side of your screen you will also see the entire game logged into a text field so that you can get an overview over the situation.

## Tech Stack
React Js

## Oponents
The pictures of the oponents were taken from Chess.com. None of their content is being used for any monetary gain and was only used to practice my skills as a web-developer
